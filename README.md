# ARLib - Alternative-Routing Library for Boost.Graph

**ARLib** is a generic library for [Boost.Graph][boost-graph] providing several
**Alternative-Routing** algorithms. Alternative routing, also known in the
literature as *alternative route planning* or *k-shortest paths with limited
overlapping*, is the problem of finding a number of *good s-t* paths in a graph.
While the problem of finding *the* shortest path between a pair of nodes has
been intensively studied and efficient solutions are well-known (most notably
the [Dijkstra's algorithm]), finding several, high-quality paths introduces some
challenges. In fact, we look for *s-t* paths that are **(a)** as short as
possible **(b)** sufficiently dissimilar from each other.

### Features

ARLib implements the following state-of-the-art algorithms to solve the problem:
 - *k-SPwLO* OnePass+
 - *k-SPwLO* ESX
 - Penalty

Moreover, the following algorithms are also available:
 - Bidirectional Dijkstra - *A speed-up variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that
   searches the graph both from the source and the target for faster
   convergence*.
 - Uninformed Bidirectional Pruner - *A pre-processing algorithm to prune a 
   graph from those vertices that unlikely could be part of an s-t path*.
