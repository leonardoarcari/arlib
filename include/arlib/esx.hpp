 * An implementation of ESX k-shortest path with limited overlap for

 *
 * Theodoros Chondrogiannis, Panagiotis Bouros, Johann Gamper and Ulf Leser,
 * Exact and Approximate Algorithms for Finding k-Shortest Paths with Limited
 * Overlap , In Proc. of the 20th Int. Conf. on Extending Database Technology
 * (EDBT) (2017)
 *
 * @tparam Graph A Boost::VertexAndEdgeListGraph
 * @tparam WeightMap The weight or "length" of each edge in the graph. The
 *         weights must all be non-negative, and the algorithm will throw a
 *         negative_edge exception is one of the edges is negative. The type
 *         WeightMap must be a model of Readable Property Map. The edge
 *         descriptor type of the graph needs to be usable as the key type for
 *         the weight map. The value type for this map must be the same as the
 *         value type of the distance map.
 * @tparam MultiPredecessorMap The multi predecessor map records the edges in
 *         the alternative paths from @p s to @p t. Upon completion of the
 *         algorithm, for any vertex `v` on any alternative path `p`, multi
 *         predecessor map stores the predecessor of node `v` on path `p`. If no
 *         predecessor for a node `v'` is reported, then `v'` is not part of any
 *         alternative path or it is the source node @p s. The type of
 *         `MultiPredecessorMap` must be a model of `Read Property Map`. The
 *         vertex descriptor of the input graph @p G must be usable as a key
 *         type for the multi predecessor map. Whereas the value type must
 *         satisfy the `UnorderedAssociativeContainer` concept, where its key is
 *         an `int`, the index/number of alternative path for which it exists a
 *         predecessor of `v`, and where the value type is a vertex descriptor
 *         of input graph @p G.
 * @tparam Vertex The vertex descriptor.
 * @param G The input graph.
 * @param weight The weight map of @p G.
 * @param predecessors The multi predecessor map of @p G.
 * @param s The source node.
 * @param t The target node.
 * @param k The number of alternative paths to compute.
 * @param theta The similarity threshold.
 * @param algorithm The routing kernel to employ. The default is
 *        routing_kernels::astar
